Introduction
=============

{ggcharts} package was published on CRAN. {ggcharts} aims to get you to your desired plot faster. It provides a high-level interface for creating common plots using {ggplot2} and does the heavy lifting for you. The resulting plots are ggplot objects so you can further tweak them using any {ggplot2} function.
